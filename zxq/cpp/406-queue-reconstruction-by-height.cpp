 * Testcase Example:  '[[7,0],[4,4],[7,1],[5,0],[6,1],[5,2]]'
 *
 * You are given an array of people, people, which are the attributes of some
 * people in a queue (not necessarily in order). Each people[i] = [hi, ki]
 * represents the i^th person of height hi with exactly ki other people in
 * front who have a height greater than or equal to hi.
 * 
 * Reconstruct and return the queue that is represented by the input array
 * people. The returned queue should be formatted as an array queue, where
 * queue[j] = [hj, kj] is the attributes of the j^th person in the queue
 * (queue[0] is the person at the front of the queue).
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: people = [[7,0],[4,4],[7,1],[5,0],[6,1],[5,2]]
 * Output: [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]]
 * Explanation:
 * Person 0 has height 5 with no other people taller or the same height in
 * front.
 * Person 1 has height 7 with no other people taller or the same height in
 * front.
 * Person 2 has height 5 with two persons taller or the same height in front,
 * which is person 0 and 1.
 * Person 3 has height 6 with one person taller or the same height in front,
 * which is person 1.
 * Person 4 has height 4 with four people taller or the same height in front,
 * which are people 0, 1, 2, and 3.
 * Person 5 has height 7 with one person taller or the same height in front,
 * which is person 1.
 * Hence [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]] is the reconstructed queue.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: people = [[6,0],[5,0],[4,0],[3,2],[2,2],[1,4]]
 * Output: [[4,0],[5,0],[2,2],[3,2],[1,4],[6,0]]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= people.length <= 2000
 * 0 <= hi <= 10^6
 * 0 <= ki < people.length
 * It is guaranteed that the queue can be reconstructed.
